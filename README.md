# Sofia AI — Live Multimodal Concierge for Hotels

**A live, multimodal AI concierge that sees, hears, and speaks with hotel guests across 5 channels — voice, video, phone calls, WhatsApp, and web chat — executing 23 live tools with Google Search grounding. Powered by Gemini Live API, deployed on Google Cloud Run.**

> Built for the [Gemini Live Agent Challenge](https://geminiliveagentchallenge.devpost.com/) — Category: **Live Agents**

## Live Demo

**[sofia-ai-942607221166.europe-west1.run.app](https://sofia-ai-942607221166.europe-west1.run.app)**

Deployed on Google Cloud Run (europe-west1). Try voice mode, video mode, or text chat — all features are live.

## The Problem

Hotel front desks are overwhelmed. Guests ask the same questions in 5 languages, calls go unanswered after hours, and booking inquiries slip through the cracks. Existing chatbots are text-only, turn-based, and disconnected from hotel systems.

## The Solution

Sofia is a **live, multimodal AI agent** that doesn't just answer questions — she *acts*. She checks real room availability, creates booking offers with payment links, looks up reservations by Booking.com confirmation codes, and sends follow-up messages on WhatsApp. She does this while speaking naturally, understanding what guests show her through their camera, and knowing their GPS location for directions.

### 5 Live Channels

| Channel | Technology | Capabilities |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Voice Mode** | Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio via WebSocket | Real-time speech, affective dialog, proactive audio |
| **Video Mode** | Camera + Audio + GPS → Gemini Live | See menus, landmarks, documents; give directions from user's position |
| **Phone Calls** | SIP/RTP bridge → Gemini Live | Answer real hotel calls, G.711 audio conversion, caller identification |

## Architecture

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **Server-side AI only** — All Gemini API calls on the server. No API keys in client bundles.
- **Context caching** — 15k-token system instruction cached 1 hour via `GoogleAICacheManager` (~90% input token cost savings).
- **Non-blocking function calls** — Slow tools use `behavior: "NON_BLOCKING"` so Sofia continues talking while APIs respond, then uses `scheduling: "INTERRUPT"` to speak results immediately.
- **Dual Gemini models** — Gemini 3 Flash for text (1M context, reasoning), Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for voice/video/phone (bidirectional streaming).
- **Phone index** — SHA-256 hash map of guest phones → reservation data, refreshed every 30 min for instant caller identification.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **AI Models** | Gemini 3 Flash (chat/WhatsApp), Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio (voice/video/phone) |
| **SDK** | `@google/genai` (GenAI SDK) + `@google/generative-ai` (cache manager) |
| **Backend** | Node.js 22, Express 5, WebSocket (`ws`) |
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Vite 6 |
| **Cloud** | Google Cloud Run (europe-west1), Artifact Registry |
| **APIs** | HotelInCloud, Google Maps/Places, Bokun Tours, Open-Meteo, Meta WhatsApp Cloud API |
| **Phone** | Node.js SIP/RTP bridge (G.711 u-law ↔ PCM resampling, 20ms pacing) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (for Cloud Run deployment — no Docker required)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/laurentisakaj/sofia-ai-hackathon.git
cd sofia-ai-hackathon

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env from template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY and COOKIE_SECRET

# Run locally
npm start
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173` (frontend) proxying to `http://localhost:3000` (backend).

| `ENCRYPTION_SALT` | If encryption enabled | Salt for key derivation |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | No | For places and directions tools |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` | No | For email notifications |
| `HOTELINCLOUD_EMAIL`, `HOTELINCLOUD_PASSWORD`, `HOTELINCLOUD_TOTP_SECRET` | No | For live hotel booking integration |
| `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` | No | For WhatsApp channel |

### Deploy to Google Cloud Run

```bash
# One-click deployment (no Docker required — builds in the cloud)
./deploy-gcp.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID europe-west1

# Then set your API key:
gcloud run services update sofia-ai \
  --region=europe-west1 --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --set-env-vars="GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key,COOKIE_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

## How It Works

### Voice & Video Mode Flow

1. User taps microphone (voice) or camera (video) button → consent modal for permissions
2. Frontend captures audio via `getUserMedia`, streams PCM chunks over WebSocket to `/ws/voice`
3. In video mode: camera frames captured at 1 FPS as JPEG, GPS coordinates sent alongside
4. Server connects to Gemini Live API (`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview`) with bidirectional streaming
5. When Gemini calls a tool, server executes via `executeToolCall()` with `NON_BLOCKING` behavior
6. Sofia speaks results naturally, continues talking during slow API calls

### Phone Call Flow

1. Guest calls hotel → no answer → Messagenet VoIP forwards to Sofia
2. `sip-register.js` answers (SIP REGISTER + INVITE), extracts caller number
3. `sip-bridge.js` bridges RTP audio: G.711 u-law 8kHz → PCM 16kHz → WebSocket
4. Server proxies to Gemini Live with all 23 tools available
5. Caller identified? Sofia greets by name ("Buongiorno, Signor Rossi!")
6. After call: transcript emailed to staff, WhatsApp follow-up with booking link

### WhatsApp Flow

1. Guest sends message → Meta webhook → signature verification → rate limiting
2. Message type handling: text, voice transcription (Gemini), image understanding (Gemini)
3. Gemini chat session with all tools → rich reply with booking options, tour links, etc.
4. Interactive Flows: native WhatsApp forms for booking, check-in, tours, feedback
5. Mid-call WhatsApp: after phone quotation, auto-sends booking template to caller
